Heart Disease Prediction

1.Introduction-
This problem presents a dataset of patients with two conditions, one is the presence of heart disease and the other is the absence of heart disease. The preprocessed data consists of 303 observations with 14 variables including one class variable named as “target”. Five major techniques and models are used for prediction: Logistic Regression , Regularized regression with Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net, RandomForest, GBT and Neural networks. Analysis shows that neural network predicts the heart disease with the highest accuracy.
2.PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem defines to find out patterns in the patient’s dataset to predict the presence of heart disease by examining the other factors present in the dataset. 
3.Dataset:
There are 14 variables in the dataset named: Age, sex,  cp(Chest pain),trestbp(resting blood pressure), chol(cholesterol), fbs(fasting blood sugar), restecg(resting electrocardiographic results), thalach(maximum heart rate achieved), exang(exercise induced angina), oldpeak(ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest), slope(the slope of the peak exercise ST segment), ca(number of major vessels), thal, target. The ‘target’ variable is the goal or outcome variable in the dataset with two values- 0 for presence of disease and 1 for absence of disease. Out of 14 variables, 6 variables have binary values including target variable and rest all variables are numerical variables.
